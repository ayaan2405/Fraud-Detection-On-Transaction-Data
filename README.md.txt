# Fraud Detection System (Machine Learning)

A complete end-to-end fraud detection system built using classical ML techniques on highly imbalanced transaction data.  
The project demonstrates preprocessing, SMOTE oversampling, class-weighted models, hyperparameter tuning, and threshold optimization using precision-recall curves.
